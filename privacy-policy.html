                    <p>In general, We collect, store and use your information to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. For example, We may use information collected from you in any one or more of the following ways:</p>
                    <div class="inner-list-privacy">
                      <ul>
                        <li>To create your game accounts and allow play of our games</li>

                        <li>To notify users of in-game updates</li>
                        <li>To provide in-game leader boards and promote in-game player achievements</li>
                        <li>To solicit input and feedback to improve Artoon Solutions products and services and customize your user experience</li>
                        <li>To inform users about new products or promotional offers</li>
                        <li>To engage in commonly accepted practices, such as contacting you at the email address We have on file if you are a potential winner in a sweepstakes</li>
                      </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>One important use of your information is communication. If you have provided your e-mail address to Artoon Solutions, We'll use it to respond to (i) customer support inquiries, and (ii) keep you informed of your in-game activity, including comments from friends, notifications about in-game status such as "Your Turn" as well as notifications of game request. Some messages, such as invites for friends to join you in a game, may include your name and profile photo. We may also send promotional e-mail messages and promotional SMS messages ("Promotional Communications") directly or in partnership with parties other than Artoon Solutions. Each Promotional Communication will generally offer recipients choices about receiving additional messages.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div id="p_5" class="introducion">
                    <h3 class="index-heading">5. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
                    <p>We will share your information (in some cases personal information) with third parties, that is parties other than Artoon Solutions, in the following circumstances:</p>
                    <p class="t-bold">Third Party Service Providers</p>
                    <p>We will provide your information to third party companies to perform services on our behalf, including payment processing, data analysis, e-mail delivery, hosting services, customer service and to assist Us in our marketing efforts. We direct all such third party service providers to maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed to them and to not use your information for any purpose other than to provide services on Artoon Solutions's behalf.</p>
                    <p class="t-bold">Friends and Other Artoon Solutions Players</p>
                    <p>The Service supports and may encourage interaction among players. In most Artoon Solutions games your SNS friends will see your name, profile photo and descriptions of your game activity. In many Artoon Solutions games friends and other players will be able to see your game profile, which may include your name or a &ldquo;game name&rdquo; and your profile photo, which in certain cases can reveal your SNS User ID number or Artoon Solutions ID. For example, in Teen Patti Three Cards Poker any other player may encounter your game profile, if you are playing. Access to a Artoon Solutions ID or your SNS User ID may allow others to view the public information associated with your related SNS or Artoon Solutions account. Other players may also be able to send you game requests or even friend requests through the related SNS&rsquo; communication channels.</p>
                    <p class="t-bold">Advertising of Third Party Products and Services</p>
                    <p>We do not actively share personal information with third party advertisers for their direct marketing purposes unless you give Us your consent.</p>
                    <p>We may share (i) aggregated information (information about you and other users collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you); (ii) anonymous information; and (iii) certain technical information (including IP Addresses, MAC Addresses for mobile devices and mobile device IDs) to develop and deliver targeted advertising in the Service and on the websites of third parties. We may also allow advertisers to collect these types of information within the Service and they may share it with Us. Advertisers may collect this information through the use of tracking technologies like browser cookies and web beacons. The information collected may be used to offer you targeted ad-selection and delivery in order to personalize your user experience by ensuring that advertisements for products and services you see will appeal to you, a practice known as behavioral advertising, and to undertake web analytics (i.e. to analyze traffic and other end user activity to improve your experience). To learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of this type of advertising for participating ad networks, you can visit the GFNetwork Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance.</p>
                    <p>Our collection, use, and disclosure of anonymous or aggregated information are not subject to any of the restrictions in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <p class="t-bold">Offer Walls</p>
                    <p>Artoon Solutions games or their purchase pages may display an "offer wall" that is hosted by an offer wall provider. The offer wall allows third party advertisers to provide virtual currency to users in exchange for interacting with an advertisement or for completing a marketing offer that may include signing up for an account with one of those advertisers. These are not offers made by Artoon Solutions. These offers may be displayed to you based on certain technical information, such as your geographic area or anonymous demographic information. After clicking on one of these advertisements, you will no longer be on a site hosted by Artoon Solutions or a partnering SNS. To properly credit user accounts and to prevent fraud, a unique identifier, in some cases your user ID number, will be shared with the offer wall provider.</p>
                    <p class="t-bold">Safety, Security and Compliance with Law</p>
                    <p>Your information, and the contents of all of your online communications (including without limitation chat text, voice communications, IP addresses and your personal information) may be accessed and monitored as necessary to provide the Service and may be disclosed: (i) when We have a good faith belief that We are required to disclose the information in response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena); (ii) to satisfy any applicable laws or regulations (iii) where We believe that the Service is being used in the commission of a crime, including to report such criminal activity or to exchange information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction; (iv) when We have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the health and/or safety of you, another person or the public generally; and (v) in order to protect the rights or property of Artoon Solutions, including to enforce our Terms of Service.</p>
                    <p class="t-bold">Sale or Merger</p>
                    <p>In the event that Artoon Solutions undergoes a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, We may transfer all of your information, including personal information, to the successor organization in such transition. If material changes to Artoon Solutions's privacy practices will occur as a result of the business transition, We will notify you and other users (in the manner described in Section 12) of the business transition prior to transferring your personal information.</p>
