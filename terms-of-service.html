                                <h4 class="inner_sub_title">1.1. Governing Agreement</h4>
                                <p>The terms of this agreement ("Terms of Service" or &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) govern the relationship between you and Artoon Solutions (hereinafter "Artoon Solutions" or "Us" or "We") regarding your use of Artoon Solutions&rsquo;s social games and related services, which include applications for mobile devices and Artoon Solutions branded websites (the "Service"). In this agreement, "Artoon Solutions" means Artoon Solutions. In either case &ldquo;Artoon Solutions&rdquo; includes Affiliates, which shall mean subsidiaries, parent companies, joint ventures and other corporate entities under common ownership.</p>
                                <h4 class="inner_sub_title">1.2. Privacy Policy</h4>
                                <p>Use of the Service is also governed by Artoon Solutions's Privacy Policy, which is incorporated herein by reference. Your privacy is important to Us. We designed Artoon Solutions's Privacy Policy to make important disclosures about how We collect and use your content and information and how you can use the Service to share such information with others. We encourage you to read the Artoon Solutions&rsquo;s Privacy Policy carefully and use it to make informed decisions.</p>
                                <p>By creating an account or accessing or using the Service you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and consent to the collection, use and storage of your information as outlined in Artoon Solutions Privacy Policy.</p>
                                <h4 class="inner_sub_title">1.3. Updates to the Terms of Service and Artoon Solutions Privacy Policy</h4>
                                <p>Artoon Solutions reserves the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of these Terms of Service and its Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended Terms on or within the Service. You may also be given additional notice, such as an e-mail message or messaging within the Service, of any changes. You will be deemed to have accepted such changes by continuing to use the Service. Except as otherwise stated, all amended terms shall automatically be effective 30 days after they are initially posted. Artoon Solutions may also revise other policies, codes or rules at any time, and the new versions will be available at www.artoonsolutions.com or in the Service. No amendment to the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy shall apply to any dispute of which Artoon Solutions had actual notice before the date of the amendment.</p>
                                <p>This agreement may not be otherwise amended except in a writing hand signed by you and Us. For purposes of this provision, "writing" does not include an e-mail message and a signature does not include an electronic signature.</p>
                                <p>If at any point you do not agree to any portion of the then-current version of our Terms of Service, the Artoon Solutions Privacy Policy, or any other Artoon Solutions policy, rules or codes of conduct relating to your use of the Service, your license to use the Service shall immediately terminate and you must immediately stop using the Service.</p>
                                <p>To the extent the Terms of Service or Artoon Solutions Privacy Policy conflict with any other Artoon Solutions terms, policy, rules or codes of conduct, the terms contained in these Terms of Service and in the Artoon Solutions Privacy Policy shall govern.</p>
                                <h4 class="inner_sub_title">1.4. Grant of a Limited License to Use the Service</h4>
                                <p>Subject to your agreement and continuing compliance with these Terms of Service and any other relevant Artoon Solutions policies, such as the Forum Rules or Loyalty Program Terms, Artoon Solutions grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable limited license subject to the limitations in Sections 1.5-1.9 to access and use the Service using a Artoon Solutions supported web browser (such as Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer) or mobile device solely for your own non-commercial entertainment purposes. You agree not to use the Service for any other purpose.</p>
                                <p>You understand that while at times you may &ldquo;earn&rdquo; "buy" or "purchase" (a) virtual currency, including but not limited to virtual coins, cash, tokens, or points, all for use in the Service; or (b) virtual in-game items (together with virtual currency, "Virtual Items"); these real world terms are only being used as shorthand. You do not in fact "own" the Virtual Items and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Rather, you may purchase a limited license to use the Service, including software programs that occasionally manifest themselves as these items. The purchase and sale of the limited license referred to in these Terms of Service is a completed transaction upon receipt of your direct payment or redemption of a Artoon Solutions game card or a third party virtual currency like Facebook Credits. Any "virtual currency" balance shown in your Account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your license.</p>

You may also be required to register an account on the Service (an "Account"), have a valid account on the social networking service ("SNS") through which you connect to the Service, if any, or have an account with the applications provider for your mobile device. You warrant that you are not prohibited from receiving products of Surat, Gujarat, India origin, including services or software. If you are between the ages of 13 and 17, you represent that your legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms.</p>
                                <p>You must provide all equipment and software necessary to connect to the Service, including, but not limited to, a mobile device that is suitable to connect with and use the Service, in cases where the Service offers a mobile component.</p>
